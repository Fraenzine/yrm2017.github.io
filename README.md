YRM2017
========

**The ETSF Young researchers' Meeting (YRM)** is a series of conferences held
annually under the auspices of the European Theoretical Spectroscopy Facility
(ETSF). It brings together young researchers (PhD students and postdocs)
working in the field of ab-initio electronic structure of real materials and
gives them an opportunity to present their work to an international audience.
All young researchers are invited to apply through the ETSF YRM 2016 web-page
and submit an abstract for a poster or an oral contribution.

The YRM 2017 will be held at ICIQ, Tarragona, Spain on June 5-9.
