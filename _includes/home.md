The ETSF Young Researchers' Meeting (YRM) is an annual workshop for
non-permanent scientists (mainly postdocs and PhD students) working in the
field of theoretical electronic structure of real materials. It addresses
challenges and recent development in the theory (density-functional, many-body
theory, model systems) and in the methods (molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo
simulations, code development in general). The ETSF YRM is a unique chance for
young researchers to present their work to an international audience where
scientific discussions are encouraged by a friendly atmosphere.

This year's ETSF YRM will host the following five topical sessions:

 * **Structure prediction and phase transitions**
 * **Strongly correlated electrons and quantum magnetism**
 * **Electronic excitations**
 * **Vibrations and electron-phonon coupling**
 * **Quantum transport and electron dynamics**

Keynote talks at the beginning of each session are intended to provide the
participants with an overview of the field, including and introduction to the
theoretical framework, state-of-the-art methods and open questions.

One day will be dedicated to researchers from the private sector giving the
participants the opportunity to discover research outside the academia.
