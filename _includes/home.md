The [ETSF Young Researchers' Meeting](about) (YRM) is an annual workshop for
non-permanent scientists, mainly postdocs and PhD students, who work on
theoretical and computational methods for the study of the electronic and optical
properties of materials.
It gives young researchers a chance to showcase their work, exchange ideas with others at their own level, learn novel techniques, start new collaborations, and improve their presentation skills.

The YRM 2017 will be held from June 5-9 at the [ICIQ](venue) in
Tarragona, Spain, and will host the following five [topical sessions](program):

 * **Structure prediction and phase transitions**
 * **Strongly correlated electrons and quantum magnetism**
 * **Electronic excitations**
 * **Vibrations and electron-phonon coupling**
 * **Quantum transport and electron dynamics**

Keynote talks at the beginning of each session give the participants an
overview of the field, introducing the theoretical framework, state-of-the-art
methods and open questions.

One day will be dedicated to researchers from the private sector giving the
participants the opportunity to discover research outside the academia.
